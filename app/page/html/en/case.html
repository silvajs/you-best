            <p class="people-desc">A normal boy who was doing well at school, Joshua suddenly started having seizure-like attacks on a daily basis. He was eventually unable to attend school and his condition began having a detrimental effect on the whole family. Desperately worried after being told by a psychologist that nothing could be done and that their son would simply grow out of his condition, Joshua's parents decided to seek a second opinion from Best Doctors.</p>
            <p class="people-desc">The Best Doctors expert who reviewed Joshua's case confirmed that the attacks were indeed psychiatric-related. His report provided not only new specific treatment recommendations but peace of mind from confirmation of diagnosis. Moreover, it reduced the number of attacks. Joshua used to experience three or four attacks a day and now has four weeks between episodes. He is back at school, and the entire family is now feeling much less stressed, stronger, and very relieved.</p>

            <p class="people-desc">Joanne had been grappling with lower back pain for almost a year. An MRI of her spine indicated degenerative changes, with mild disc bulges and borderline nerve changes. Her orthopedic surgeon believed that spinal instability was the cause of her pain and recommended spinal fusion – a major surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae and takes hours.</p>
            <p class="people-desc">Joanne turned to Best Doctors, who forwarded her case to a Neurosurgeon and Assistant Dean at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The expert concluded that Joanne’s symptoms were not consistent with spinal instability, but represented mechanical back pain. Rather than endorse surgery, he recommended muscle strengthening and weight reduction, which helped Joanne reduce her pain effectively.</p>

            <p class="people-desc">Will had been taking medication for gastrointestinal reflux (GERD) for several years when he started to experience symptoms so severe that he had to take extended sick leave from work.</p>
            <p class="people-desc">His primary care physician (PCP) referred him back to the specialist, who gave him the option of lifelong medication or surgery. Confused and needing more information, Will decided to contact Best Doctors.</p>
            <p class="people-desc">The expert gastroenterologist chosen by Best Doctors agreed with the GERD diagnosis but believed that not all of Will’s symptoms were caused by this and recommended further testing. He considered surgery as a last resort but discussed the pros and cons of both treatment alternatives.</p>
            <p class="people-desc">Will shared the Best Doctors findings with his treating physician, who agreed with the expert that surgery was not the best option. Will and his PCP then took the best and most informed decision for his health.</p>

            <p class="people-desc">After a battle with thyroid cancer, Evelyn lived cancer-free for 32 years – until a lung cancer diagnosis. “My head was spinning,” she says. “I couldn’t even think.” Evelyn’s case was reviewed by a Best Doctors pathologist at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. After studying Evelyn’s cancer cells and ordering additional tests, he concluded that Evelyn was experiencing a thyroid cancer recurrence, not lung cancer – even though the tumor was in her lung.</p>
            <p class="people-desc">Best Doctors put Evelyn’s case in the hands of a nationally recognized thyroid cancer expert from Johns Hopkins. Today, instead of facing the deadliest of all cancers, Evelyn is dealing with a cancer she has fought before – and beaten.</p>
